## Probably the best application for stream addicts!

If you are one of those (well, I am) that can watch the entire Breaking Bad with only toilet breaks and still wonder what to watch up next, then screenslump is the app for you! 

Its work is simple, yet ingenious. A *slump* derives from the Swedish word for *random*, and that's exactly what screenslump does; showing you randomly selected IMDb titles for you to watch up next. 

Have a happy slumping! 

## How to install


	rake db:migrate

Once in a while, you can enter [your_domain].com/fetch for fetching new movie titles. Please notice that this is a work in progress and that the app will often crash due to long waiting times. This would rather be done as a (chopped) background job (perhaps cron) in the future.
