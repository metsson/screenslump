## Probably the best application for stream addicts!

If you are one of those (well, I am) that can watch the entire Breaking Bad with only toilett breaks and still wonder what to watch up next, then screenslump is the app for you! 

Its work is simple, yet ingenious. A *slump* derives from the Swedish for *random*, and that's exactly what screenslump does; showing you randomly selected IMDb titles for you to watch up next. 

Have a happy slumping!
